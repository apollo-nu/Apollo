# Apollo

### An easy-to-use, interactive tool for Northwestern students to plan their courses.

Apollo is a web application designed to give Northwestern students an easier alternative to managing their four-year (or more) plans. Using the Northwestern Course API, Apollo exposes a clean interface where students can easily organize their courses in a draggable, grid-arranged fashion.

Apollo is currently in beta, and is still receiving updates to add crucial features. You can still interact with the current working prototype [here](https://apollo-nu.herokuapp.com/)!
